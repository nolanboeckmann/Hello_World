# About Me
Hi everyone, thanks for stopping by to take a look at my GitHub profile!

I'm currently a Junior at the University of Iowa, double-majoring in Finance, and Business Analytics and Information Systems.

I'm originally from the Des Moines metro, but have lived in the Quad Cities and now the Iowa City - Coralville area.
